UI libraries
============

Datatable
----------------------

Revogrid, see code snippets.
Tabulator.info is another option.

Select
----------

Tom-select is select2 alternative without jquery dependency.
Choices.js is another option.


Scripting
---------

For simple tasks whose code can be generated by AI, Javascript code will be used.
Otherwise, will be using pyscript (micropython version) for client side scripting
if necessary for complex stuff (just because python is nicer to write than js).
Pyscript is chosen instead of brython because (I hope) it has better debugging support.


HTMX
----

This is to provide simple interactive HTML, to avoid writing js code for simple tasks.

Styling and UI layout
---------------------

See admini (https://github.com/lekoala/admini) for some ideas.

Installation
------------

- use vvg-box to install the main app
- Python 3.14 will be installed (provide uuid7 among others)
- symbolic link VVG_BASEDIR/pyprojects.toml to the app pyprojects.toml
- symbolic link VVG_BASEDIR/app.py to the app app.py file
- VVG_BASEDIR/instances/domain-name will be the main point for running the application
- VVG_BASEDIR/instances/domain-name/db is used for sqlite and caching
